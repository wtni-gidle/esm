"""ESMFold2 featurizer, multi-chain and decode tests.

Everything here runs on CPU against a tiny randomly-initialised model with
synthetic LM states, so no PLM backbone and no published weights are needed.
The one external artifact is the CCD pickle: ``prepare_esmfold2_input`` reads
idealized conformers out of it for every residue, so a runner without
``ESMCFOLD_CCD_PATH`` downloads ``biohub/ESMFold2:ccd.pkl`` once.

Non-protein entities (C6) are covered by the featurizer's own
``prepare_input_test.py`` and the MSA path (C7) by the MSA suite; neither is
duplicated here.
